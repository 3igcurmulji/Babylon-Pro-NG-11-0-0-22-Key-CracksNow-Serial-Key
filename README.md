 Cooling Tower Institute Blue Book PDF: What Is It and How to Get It? 
Cooling towers are devices that use water evaporation to transfer heat from a process or a building to the atmosphere. They are widely used in industrial and commercial applications, such as power plants, chemical plants, refineries, data centers, and air conditioning systems. Cooling towers can improve the energy efficiency and environmental performance of these systems, but they also require proper design, operation, and maintenance to ensure optimal performance and safety.
 
Cooling Tower Institute (CTI) is a non-profit organization that provides technical guidance, standards, certification, education, and research on cooling tower technology. CTI publishes various publications and manuals that cover different aspects of cooling tower engineering and practice. One of these publications is the CTI Blue Book, which is the official title of the **CTI Toolkit**, a CD-ROM that contains a collection of useful software and documents for cooling tower users.

## What is the CTI Blue Book?
 
The CTI Blue Book is a CD-ROM that contains several software programs and documents that can help cooling tower users with the design, selection, performance evaluation, operation, and maintenance of cooling towers. Some of the software programs included in the CTI Blue Book are:
 
- **CTI ATC-105**: A program that can calculate the thermal performance of cooling towers based on the Merkel method.
- **CTI ATC-106**: A program that can calculate the thermal performance of cooling towers based on the effectiveness-NTU method.
- **CTI ATC-128**: A program that can calculate the drift loss from cooling towers.
- **CTI ATC-140**: A program that can calculate the plume abatement from cooling towers.
- **CTI ATC-142**: A program that can calculate the sound pressure level from cooling towers.
- **CTI ATC-143**: A program that can calculate the water consumption from cooling towers.
- **CTI ATC-144**: A program that can calculate the water quality from cooling towers.
- **CTI ATC-145**: A program that can calculate the energy consumption from cooling towers.
- **CTI ATC-146**: A program that can calculate the environmental impact from cooling towers.
- **CTI ATC-147**: A program that can calculate the life cycle cost from cooling towers.

The CTI Blue Book also contains several documents that provide technical information and guidance on cooling tower technology. Some of these documents are:

- **CTI Codes and Standards**: A collection of codes and standards that define the minimum requirements and best practices for cooling tower design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance.
- **CTI Guidelines**: A collection of guidelines that provide recommendations and suggestions for cooling tower design, selection, performance evaluation, operation, and maintenance.
- **CTI Manuals**: A collection of manuals that provide detailed instructions and procedures for cooling tower design, selection, performance evaluation, operation, and maintenance.
- **CTI Handbooks**: A collection of handbooks that provide comprehensive and practical information on various topics related to cooling tower technology.
- **CTI Technical Papers**: A collection of technical papers that present the latest research and development on cooling tower technology.

## How to get the CTI Blue Book?
 
The CTI Blue Book is available for purchase from the CTI website . The price of the CD-ROM is $250 for CTI members and $500 for non-members. The CD-ROM is updated annually with new software and documents. The CTI website also provides a list of contents  and a sample  of the CTI Blue Book for preview. Alternatively, you can access some of the software programs and documents online through the CTI web-based toolkit , which requires a subscription fee of $100 per year for CTI members and $200 per year for non-members.
 
## Conclusion
 
The CTI Blue Book is a valuable resource for cooling tower users who want to improve their knowledge and skills on cooling tower technology. It contains a variety of software programs and documents that can help with the design, selection, performance evaluation, operation, and maintenance of cooling towers. You can purchase the CD-ROM or access the web-based toolkit from the CTI website.
